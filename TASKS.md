### Detect and alarm on project regression (griefing/attacks)

**Status:** Backlog
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:**
When project progress changes are detected, analyze whether the change represents forward progress (more pixels matching the project) or regression (fewer pixels matching). A regression likely indicates that the project is being attacked/griefed and should trigger an alarm or notification.

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Need to track project completion percentage over time
- Define threshold for what constitutes a "significant" regression worth alarming on
- Decide on alarm mechanism (log level, notification, etc.)
- May want to distinguish between minor griefing and coordinated attacks based on regression magnitude

**Related Code:**
- `Project.run_diff()` in `src/cam/projects.py` (where diffs are computed)
- Progress tracking would need to be added to the `Project` class

### ✅ Intelligent tile checking with warm/cold queues (2026-02-07)

Implemented temperature-based queue system with Zipf distribution for intelligent tile monitoring: burning queue for never-checked tiles, multiple hot-to-cold temperature queues based on modification times, round-robin selection across queues choosing least-recently-checked tiles, and surgical repositioning with cascade mechanics when tiles move to hotter queues. Includes 23 comprehensive tests and integration with `TileChecker`.

### ✅ Fix tile polling - only check ONE tile per cycle (2026-02-07)

Implemented round-robin tile checking that processes exactly one tile per polling cycle instead of checking all tiles. Added `current_tile_index` to `Main` class to track rotation position with automatic wraparound, preventing unnecessary bandwidth usage and backend hammering. Includes proper edge case handling for empty/modified tile lists and comprehensive test coverage.
