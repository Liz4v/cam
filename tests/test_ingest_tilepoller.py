"""
Tests for ingest module (TilePoller removed as part of unified polling refactor).
TilePoller has been removed in favor of direct has_tile_changed calls in the main polling loop.
"""

# These tests are kept as placeholders in case TilePoller functionality needs to be restored
# or for historical reference. The actual TilePoller class has been removed from ingest.py.
